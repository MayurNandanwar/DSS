-->Cloud Watch is a monitoring service 
--> when to use ?
  --> it is used when you have to continuous monitor the services like CPU utilization of instance, monitor that traffic come
      to your website if it is more or less so we can increase or decrease the instance based on cpu utilization, also 
      monitor your website is access or any error came  based on configuration and if not accessed then it 
      send Alert messages to user 

  --> you can create your own dashboard and also custom dashboard for monitoring services 

  --> for each service AWS provide the dashboard form monitor 
  --> most of services AWS Monitors.


  Note: in AWS default monitoring time is 5 min every 5 min graph will update with information 
  but what if you required updation for every 1 min 
  ex. Virat kohli is famous and most likely person when he comes to play the match 
    there is backend setup that lets say set that trigger Notification services and send msg to 
    5cr user and for ex 50 lakhs user instant join the app but you get the information after 5 min 
    possibility that load increase in you app. You can also set the less time as well instead of 5 min

--> NameSpace of services in aws is like aws/service name , we can make custom metrics aswell.
--> we can make custom dashboard to monitor application application wise ex. to monitor metrics like page user hits most 
    app wise cpu utilization, storage of app etc.


## Alarm :- we can set the alarm for any namespace reach certain limit or threshold ex cpu utilization > 30 
          then Notification will go to the subscriber about that. 168 lacture.
--> alarm status are 1) In Alarm : reach threshold 
                 2) Ok : everything is ok
                 3) insufficient data : it means it in not getting data , possible that you instance is down.
--> use case 2 :  we can set alarm on billing of aws EstimateCharge > threshold then send msg 

-- we can also create Composite Alarm : lets say we have set two alarm and now we have requirement that 
  one of this alarm's status = 'In Alarm' then Composite alarm trigger or we can say that is both alarm
  status = 'In Alarm' then Composite alarm trigger 
    ex. use case in my pov : suppose mera ek cpu utilization ke liye alarm hai jissme jaise hi threshold 
    cross hua voh ec2 bana de and then billing alert se mujhe pata chal jaaye ki paisa zyada lagg rha hai.

--> if you want to see the information inside the instance then you can use Cloudwatch Agent 
    install cloudwatch agent and set configuration using wizard file and then start the coudwatch
    after successfull creation of CloudwatchAgent --> in custom Metrics you can see the all instance
     related metrics.
--> you can also install cloudwatch agent in servers available in company data-center and which will send
    data to cloud watch 


--> two typs of logs group class 1) standard and 2) infrequent 
    --> log group name will be what you configure in config file.
    --> we can check logs aswell as live log using live tail.
    --> log insight : in which we can monitor the logs ex. how many logs contains warnings, Error etc 
        using query. ex. at which time user loging the most in online shopping. if you have running application 
        and aplication have 5, 6 log file that it will appear in log group .
        --> we can filter the logs based on level , message . also see the pattern of logs and visualization 
            query we can write using prompt.

        --. also we can save the query to avoid repitative write by user.

    Note : here we can use alert message that if i get the error same message or any time out error multiple
    times in 1 hr ex 100 time i got in 1 hour then i will get the alert.
    how many users come in app in 1hour we can also monitor and generate alarm
