--> security group acts as a virtual firewall, controlling both inbound and outbound traffic 
    for EC2 instances and other resources within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

--> You define rules within a security group to allow or deny traffic based on protocols, ports,
    and source/destination IP addresses. 

Virtual Firewall:
Security groups function like firewalls, filtering network traffic to and from your AWS resources. 

Instance-Level Control:
They operate at the instance level, meaning they control traffic for individual EC2 instances or other resources associated with them. 

Inbound and Outbound Rules:
You can define rules to allow or deny traffic based on the direction (inbound or outbound). 

Stateful:
Security groups are stateful, meaning that if an inbound request is allowed, the corresponding outbound (reply) traffic is also allowed. 

Permissive Rules:
Security group rules are always permissive, meaning that you can only specify rules that allow traffic; all other traffic is implicitly blocked. 

Associated with Resources:
You associate security groups with EC2 instances, load balancers, and other resources in your VPC. 

VPC-Specific:
Security groups are specific to a VPC and cannot be used across different VPCs. 

Default Security Group:
When you create a VPC, it comes with a default security group, which you can modify or create additional security groups as needed. 

#! Note : you can only specify rules that allow traffic means ex. we have make app which is running on port 80 , and i want that 
from all IP can access except one IP because attack on my we is happening using this IP so how define deny rule to block this IP , here in security group deny rules can not define only allow rule is defined

#! note: we can assign multiple security group to one server or EC2 instance. and we do not required to restart service of instance 
we can attach security group on the fly.
