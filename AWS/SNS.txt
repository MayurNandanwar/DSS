SNS: Simple Notification System
objective: There is publisher who publish the message and it will be send to all the subscriber.

ex. you have one ecommerse website and you have to send email, then send sms, and execute lambda function 
let say when i have order TV then i will get mail from website that your TV order is placed, then send sms 
on phone number and then execute lambda function which performs the substract the ordered quentity from the 
inventory.also you have to hit the https url to count that number of order come for specific product.

This can done by application by what is the banifits for use SNS
--> what if you are sending the sms that time users mobile is switch off 
--> user email box full condition what we will do 
--> what if some how you have server connectivity problem and lambda function not triggered.

# possiblie that we run loop untill the mail or sms send to the user but this is not the ideal solution
# when situation comes that you have to hit 5 url at time and have to work with number of lambda function 
    that time scale up and sclae down how you will do , also performance matter
    every time you have to modify the code, so instead of doing this make use of SNS.

# ans of if your mobile switch off what SNS does?
--> There is Delivery Policy stage where you publish msg , 4 ways ,msg send 
    1) immidiate send: 
    2) pre-backoff phase: 
    3) backoff phase:
    4) post backoff phase: 
    we can set back-off function like linear, exponential, geometrically,arimethic.Default = linear.
    so this according msg will be send.
--> why required this backoff phases : 
    if i set number of trial to send msg = 100, set immidiate send = 10, set pre-backoff phase =10,backoff phase =30,post backoff phase=50
    --> i want that at pre backoff phase i send msg every 5 second 
    --> in backoff phase i will send every 2 min 
    --> in post backoff phase i will send 2 hour 
    this above thing can be done by this policy stages



# send SMS:
    --> click on text message register your mobile and then subscribe this number and then publish msg

# we can send sms to email, http / https url, sms, lambda function etc.
# we can send msges like about cpu utilization, as well as to automate the subsription via http urls.
