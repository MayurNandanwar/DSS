## Note: poolings are faster that stride.

# filters : filters we can say its different different pattern used to capture the features of image ex. horizontal line, vertical, curve etc. 
and we don't have to make the filters at training time filters train through forward and backward propagation.
we can say that filters are the weights which trains ati time of training and which will be apply to classify the image at prediction time

#feature_map : when filters convolves over main image then it captures the features and we get feature_map
    size of feature map = size of filters used for convolving over image , filter cal have channel 
    ex. image is 28x28x3 here 3 channel used  and 4 filter used size 3x3x3 here 3 channel padding is "same" and stride = 1,
    so feature_map size will be 28x28x4 because 4 filter is used.

    Note: more filters more information you can collect from images 
    steps 
    --> first layer filters collect basic information from images ex dash, dotes , small lines , small curves
    --> 2nd layer filters collect advance level of information like curve, horizontal line, 
    --> as network becomes deep filters captures more complex features
    Note: you can find out this from basic structure of CNN image.

# padding: is used when you don't want to loose information from the images.
--> Two type 1) valid padding and 2) same padding int(m+2p-n+1) where p is padding 

-->Valid Padding
    because convolve is operation is summation of point wise multiplication we get 1 value if we have 
    3X3 filter stride over images lets say stride = 1 then ex. 28x28 image size then 
    feature map size will be (m-n+1) means 28-3+1 =26 so 26.
    --> in valid padding we are loosing information 
-->same padding  = (m-n)+2(p)/stride +1 = 28-3+2(1)/1 +1 = 27+1 = 28


## Why pooling layer is used?
    --> pooling layer is used to reduce the size of image because of memory issue and avoid translation varience problem
        1) memory: 
        2) Translation varience: \
                It means work of convolution operation is to find out the features and sometimes
                this features are location specific but and feature should not be location specific other wise if any 
                augmented image provided which has location different, not available at time of training 
                classification at time of predict fails, using pooling this problem not comes.

    --> Types of Pooling 
        1)max pooling:
        2) min pooling:
        3)avg pooling :
        4) L2 norm pooling:
        5) global pooling:

    --> ex. max pooling : 
            --> in max pooling there is no trainable parameres it just aggregation operation 
            here same process happen here ex. size of pooling(it looks like filters) 2X2X3 and feature_map size is 28x28x3 and stride=1
            padding = valid, so gere filter convolve over feature_map that area called receptive_field  and get max value from it
            so here generated feature_map will contain only important feature,we are removing low level information
            from it. here translation varience problem is solved

    --> Dsadvantage: we loose some of information for saving memory or if we do not required low level information possible.
                     not used where location matters like image segmentation.

    --> Advantage: Reduce size of image,
                   avoid translation varience: here features shifts when use pooling opeartion
                   pooling filters ara Not required of training beacuse it is aggregation process
                   so in backpropagation nothing happen with pooling filters and thats why faster 
                   than stride.
