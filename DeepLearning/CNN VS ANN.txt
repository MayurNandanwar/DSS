Difference Between CNN VS ANN:

    1) CNN is computationally cost effective:
    --> In CNN fiter size is not depend on the size of input so weight will be fixed if you define filter 
        ex. image size 28x28x3 and lets say filter size is 3x3x3 , filter convolve over the image 
        now lets keep same filter size and change the size of image 238x238x3 and filter 3x3x3

        whare as there In ANN image increatse then flatten of image increase neuron size ex. 200x200x3 image flatten 
        is 120000 neurons and lets say in hidden layer neuron is 30 so 120000 x 30 weights ,
        ex.2 image size 28x28x3 and hidden neuron 30 so weights = 28x28x3x30 

        thats why CNN is computationally cost effective 

    2) Overfitting happen in ANN: 
        whare as there In ANN image increatse then flatten of image increase neuron size ex. 200x200x3 image flatten 
        is 120000 neurons and lets say in hidden layer neuron is 30 so 120000 x 30 weights ,
        ex.2 image size 28x28x3 and hidden neuron 30 so weights = 28x28x3x30 

        because of this in ANN overfitting happen 
        where as in CNN overfiting not happen 

    3) Loss the arrangement of pixels in ANN:
        when work with image and use ANN , so due to flattening we loss the arragement of pixels 
        here in CNN, 2D pixel arrangement captured by CNN.
