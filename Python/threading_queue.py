# requirement 
# --> each and evry task you want to run by thread is indipendent 
# otherwise possiblity of getting unreliable output(or incorrect output)


# what is Race condition 
#  ex. we want to perform summation and substraction operation and we are storing the
# result if both thread to single variable 1st thread: summation happen and 2nd thread: substraction happen
# possibility that one of thread dint get cpu for performing operation and another thread run multiple Timeo
#  we dont know so at the end we get unreliable output or incorrect output 
# called race condition


# Queue : its a linear data structure   that stores output in order way 
# type:
# 1 LIFO last in first out
# 2 FIFI first in first out
# 3 Priority Queue which provides out put in sorted way
